Designing and implementing a search engine that returns relevant documents based on user queries involves several key components: data preprocessing, indexing, query processing, and ranking. Here's a step-by-step approach to building such a system:
            
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Collection: Gather the documents that will be searched. These can come from various sources like websites, databases, or uploaded files.
Text Preprocessing:
        Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
        Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
        Removing Stop Words: Remove common words like "and", "the", "is", etc., that do not carry significant meaning.
        Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form. For example, "running" becomes "run".

2. Indexing

Inverted Index: Create an inverted index where each word maps to a list of documents (or document IDs) that contain the word.
Term Frequency (TF): Calculate how often a word appears in each document.
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Calculate the importance of a word based on how many documents it appears in. Less frequent words are considered more important.
TF-IDF: Combine TF and IDF to weigh the importance of words in documents.

3. Query Processing

Query Preprocessing: Apply the same preprocessing steps to the user query as were applied to the documents.
Vector Space Model: Represent the query as a vector in the same space as the document vectors using TF-IDF scores.

4. Ranking

Cosine Similarity: Measure the cosine similarity between the query vector and each document vector to find how similar they are. Rank the documents based on their similarity scores.
